This folder explores regression techniques used for predicting continuous and categorical outcomes. It includes notebooks with detailed explanations, EDA, and end-to-end implementation of different regression algorithms.

Contents
Linear Regression

Step-by-step implementation with three datasets.
Real-world project showcasing predictive modeling.
Logistic Regression

Implementation for binary classification problems.
Practical applications with case studies and datasets.
Polynomial Regression

Addressing non-linearity in data with polynomial transformations.
Examples and projects for higher-order regression techniques.
Key Features
EDA Integration: Each notebook starts with Exploratory Data Analysis to identify trends, outliers, and relationships in the data.
Metrics & Evaluation: Models are evaluated using metrics such as RÂ², MAE, MSE, and RMSE (for Linear Regression) and classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score (for Logistic Regression).
Practical Applications: Each regression algorithm is showcased with datasets and projects to highlight real-world utility.
How to Use
Start with the Linear Regression notebooks to understand basic regression concepts.
Progress through Logistic and Polynomial Regression for more advanced use cases.
Refer to the projects for complete end-to-end workflows.
