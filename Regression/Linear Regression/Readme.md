This folder is dedicated to Linear Regression, one of the foundational algorithms in supervised machine learning. Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a continuous target variable. It is a simple yet powerful tool for predictive analysis.

# Contents
## Model Implementations

Dataset 1: Simple Linear Regression example with a single independent variable.
Dataset 2: Multiple Linear Regression showcasing relationships between multiple features and the target variable.
Dataset 3: Advanced use case focusing on feature selection, interaction terms, and handling multicollinearity.
## Project

End-to-end project demonstrating Linear Regression for solving a real-world problem, including EDA, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
# Key Topics Covered
EDA: Insights into feature-target relationships through visualizations and summary statistics.
Model Building: Linear Regression implementation using libraries like Scikit-Learn.
Assumptions Check: Residual analysis to ensure assumptions like linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity are satisfied.
Metrics & Evaluation: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.
## Highlights
Practical Focus: Clear explanations and applications of Linear Regression in diverse datasets.
Visualization: Use of scatter plots, regression lines, residual plots, and distribution plots to interpret results.
Optimization: Techniques like feature scaling, polynomial terms, and regularization to improve performance.
