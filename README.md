# Data-Science-With-AI-ML-Note-Books
Welcome to my Data Science Notebooks repository! ðŸš€  This repository is a curated collection of my projects and practice notebooks in Data Science and Machine Learning. It showcases my learning journey, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work with real-world datasets

This repository serves to:

Demonstrate my knowledge of data analysis and machine learning.
Highlight my skills in handling real-world datasets and building models.
Showcase end-to-end workflows, including EDA, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

# Topics Covered
The repository is organized into categories:

## EDA and Preprocessing
Data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering.
## Regression
Linear, Logistic, and Polynomial Regression.
## Classification
Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbors.
## Clustering
k-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
## Dimensionality Reduction
PCA and LDA.
Each section includes Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations, well-commented code, and visualizations to illustrate concepts.

# Features
Custom Datasets: I use unique datasets collected via APIs or scraping, avoiding built-in datasets.
Step-by-Step Explanations: All notebooks include markdown descriptions for easy understanding.
Real-World Applications: Projects are practical and demonstrate a deep understanding of data science workflows.

# How to Explore
Browse folders to explore algorithms or techniques.
Open any notebook to see the code and results.
This repository reflects my commitment to continuous learning and applying data science techniques to solve problems. Feel free to explore and provide feedback! ðŸ˜Š
