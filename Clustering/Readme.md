# Clustering
This folder explores clustering techniques used for uncovering hidden patterns and grouping data points. It includes notebooks with comprehensive explanations, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and end-to-end implementations of various clustering algorithms.

# Contents
## K-Means Clustering
Step-by-step implementation of the popular centroid-based algorithm. Real-world applications showcasing efficient grouping and pattern detection.

## Hierarchical Clustering
Introduction to hierarchical methods using agglomerative and divisive approaches. Dendrogram visualizations for better interpretability.

## DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
Density-based clustering approach for detecting arbitrarily shaped clusters. Robust handling of noise and outliers.

# Key Features
- EDA Integration: Each notebook starts with Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the dataset and prepare it for clustering.
- Metrics & Evaluation: Includes evaluation methods like silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and cluster validation techniques.
- Practical Applications: Each algorithm is paired with projects, from market segmentation to anomaly detection, highlighting real-world use cases.
- Visualization: Rich visualizations, including scatter plots, dendrograms, and cluster boundaries, for enhanced interpretability.
- Parameter Tuning: Demonstrations of how to select optimal hyperparameters, such as the number of clusters or distance metrics.
# How to Use
Start with the K-Means Clustering notebook to learn the basics of unsupervised learning. Progress through other methods like DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, and GMM to understand diverse approaches. Explore projects for complete workflows demonstrating the power of clustering in various domains.
