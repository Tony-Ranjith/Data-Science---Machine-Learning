# Naive Bayes

This folder explores Naive Bayes, a probabilistic algorithm for classification tasks. Naive Bayes is based on Bayes' Theorem, assuming independence among predictors, making it simple yet effective for many real-world problems.

# Contents

## Overview

Naive Bayes classifiers are probabilistic models that use Bayes' Theorem to predict the class of a given sample. Despite their simplicity, they are highly efficient and perform well on small to medium-sized datasets.

## Key Features

Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.

Efficiency: Requires less training data and computation.

Robustness: Handles categorical and continuous data effectively.

## Implementation Highlights

### Steps Covered

Data Preparation: Importing and preprocessing datasets, including handling missing values and outliers.

EDA: Understanding dataset structure, feature distributions, and relationships.

Model Building: Constructing a Naive Bayes classifier using popular libraries like sklearn.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing smoothing parameters and feature selection for improved performance.

Evaluation: Comparing model performance against other algorithms.

### Metrics & Evaluation

Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correctly classified instances.

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Assess performance across different classes.

Confusion Matrix: Visualize true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Log-Loss: Evaluate the probabilistic predictions of the model.
