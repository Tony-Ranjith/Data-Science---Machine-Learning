# Decision Trees
This folder explores Decision Trees, a versatile and interpretable algorithm for classification and regression tasks. Decision Trees mimic human decision-making processes by splitting data into subsets based on feature values, leading to a tree-like structure.

# Contents
## Overview
Decision Trees are non-parametric models that split data into branches using feature thresholds.
They are widely used for their interpretability, efficiency, and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data.
## Key Features
Interpretability: Easily explain predictions using the tree structure.

Flexibility: Handle non-linear relationships and feature interactions naturally.

Scalability: Work well for both small and large datasets.

# Implementation Highlights
## Steps Covered
Data Preparation: Importing and preprocessing datasets, including handling missing values and outliers.

EDA: Understanding dataset structure, feature distributions, and relationships.

Model Building: Constructing a Decision Tree using popular libraries like sklearn.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing depth, minimum samples for splitting, and leaf size for improved performance.

Visualization: Plotting the Decision Tree structure for interpretability.

## Metrics & Evaluation
Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correctly classified instances.

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Assess performance across different classes.

Confusion Matrix: Visualize true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

ROC-AUC Curve: Evaluate the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.
