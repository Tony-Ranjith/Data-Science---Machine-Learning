# Support Vector Machine (SVM) 

This folder explores Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful and flexible algorithm for classification and regression tasks. SVMs work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space.

# Contents

## Overview

Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models known for their ability to handle both linear and non-linear relationships. They are widely used for their robustness, versatility, and effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces.

## Key Features

- Robustness: Effective in high-dimensional spaces and when the number of features exceeds the number of samples.

- Flexibility: Support for various kernel functions to capture non-linear relationships.

- Efficiency: Optimal for both small and large datasets with appropriate tuning.

## Implementation Highlights

### Steps Covered

- Data Preparation: Importing and preprocessing datasets, including feature scaling and handling imbalanced classes.

- EDA: Exploring dataset structure, feature distributions, and identifying potential outliers.

- Model Building: Training an SVM classifier or regressor using popular libraries like scikit-learn.

- Kernel Selection: Experimenting with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels to find the best fit for the data.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing C, gamma, and kernel parameters for improved performance.

### Metrics & Evaluation

1. Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correctly classified instances.

2. Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Evaluate performance on imbalanced datasets.

3. Confusion Matrix: Visualize true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

4. ROC-AUC Curve: Assess the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
